**DESCRIPTION OF TASK**
An AI-based recommendation system is a powerful tool used to personalize user experiences by suggesting products, movies, or content based on user preferences. This project focuses on developing such a system using Java and Apache Mahout, leveraging collaborative filtering algorithms to analyze user interactions and predict future choices. The system works by processing user data (such as ratings or purchase history), identifying patterns among users or items, and generating personalized recommendations. The key technologies used include Apache Mahout for implementing recommendation algorithms, Apache Hadoop (optional) for handling large-scale data, and Maven or Gradle for dependency management, with development in Eclipse IDE or IntelliJ IDEA. The dataset used can be from sources like MovieLens, which provides user ratings for movies. The system follows a structured approach—loading the dataset, applying collaborative filtering (user-based or item-based), training the model, generating predictions, and displaying the most relevant recommendations. The output consists of ranked suggestions tailored to user preferences, continuously improving as more data is processed. This system is widely applicable in e-commerce, streaming services, and online learning, enhancing engagement by delivering highly relevant content. By utilizing Apache Mahout’s scalable machine learning algorithms, this recommendation engine can efficiently process large datasets, making it a robust solution for businesses aiming to provide a personalized user experience.
